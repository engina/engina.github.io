          <h2>Free virtualization on headless hosts; vmware-server2 and virtualbox (vboxheadless)</h2>
<p class="meta">16 Jan 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Virtualization is cool. It gives you the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy nodes into your cluster in minutes</li>
<li>Get the most out of your hardware, even if your software is not very efficient. i.e. it is proven that multiple instances of MS IIS running on a host in separate VMs are more efficient than a single MS IIS instance on the host. Which implies that MS IIS is not engineered to utulize hardware very well.</li>
</ul>
<h3>vmware-server 2</h3>
<hr />In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installation: very easy.</li>
<li>Management: Web access did not work. VMWare Infrastructure Client did not work.</li>
<li>Stability: Crashes on guest OS update.</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, I want to say that I've used this a couple of years ago and I was very pleased with it. Now I tried to install it on CentOS 5.5 host to install a Windows 2003 guest OS. Installation was a breeze but managing the virtual machines turned into a nightmare. I couldn't reliably access to the web interface no matter what I tried. According to logs there was an error in SSL handshaking, tried to solve the issue by trying a few workarounds presented in forums, with no luck.</p>
<p>Then, I recalled that there was a native desktop application called VMWare Infrastructure Client which I used previously. It was previously located on https://host:8333/clients/ but now it is not there for some reason. It is not even in the docroot directory on the host. It simply is not there.</p>
<p>Then, with the help of google I found the executable and installed it. I connected to the host but the console was always blank (white). Then I googled a bit more to find out that VIC has some problems if it co-exists with the new VIC (VMWare sphere client). Then I removed the new client and installed the v2.5 again. This time it worked. I installed the Windows 2003 server. Mind that I occasionally lost connection to the console during this process.</p>
<p>After the initial boot, I tried to update the server through Windows Update. One of the child processes of VMWare consistently crashed at this point, rendering whole VMWare unusable. I tried a few times, it always crashed at this point with a core dump and backtrace in the logs.</p>
<p>At this point, I give up giving any more chances to vmware-server 2 on CentOS 5.5.</p>
<h3>VirtualBox</h3>
<hr />
<p>Then I started looking around if VirtualBox had support for headless hosts, it turned out it has some basic support -- with decent documentation.</p>
<p>First <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html">install VirtualBox</a> for your platform. I simply added repo to /etc/yum/repo.d and installed via yum. Then <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch08.html#vboxmanage-extpack">install extension packs</a>. Which basically boils down to this;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
[root@tr ~]# wget http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.0.0/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.0.0-69151.vbox-extpack
[root@tr ~]# VBoxManage extpack install Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.0.0-69151.vbox-extpack
</pre>
<p>See <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch07.html#id486223">Installing Guest OS on a headless VirtalBox host.</a></p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the example, it is using NAT as networking, you probably want bridged;</li>
<li>At first, I tried --cpus 4, but it gave me "Error: failed to start machine. Error message: Unknown error creating VM (VERR_VMX_MSR_LOCKED_OR_DISABLED)". I simply fell back to --cpus 1, and it is working fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've used:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">[root@tr ~]# VBoxManage modifyvm "Win2003E" --memory 2048 --acpi on --boot1 dvd --nic1 bridged --cpus 1 --bridgeadapter1 eth0</pre>
<p>Then, of course we need Guest Additions. It is a matter of clicking on traditional VirtualBox installation, but this is a headless installation. I just mounted the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso myself.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
[root@tr ~]# VBoxManage storageattach "Win2003E" --storagectl "IDE Controller" --port 0 --device 1 --type dvddrive --medium /usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso
</pre>
<p>It automatically starts the setup, just follow the wizard and you'll be on your way.</p>
<p>
At this point, you should have Windows 2003 server up and running with VirtualBox Guest additions. I'd also recommend taking snapshots along the way.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
[root@tr ~]# VBoxManage snapshot "Win2003E" take "VBox guest additions installed"
</pre>
<p>
Nice.</p></p>
