<p>In the third installment of the series :) I have managed to get my package in my third visit to customs. This time everything took 2 hours I paid another €23 (for storage I think). OK, it boils down to this;</p>
<p>1. Ordered items cost: € 524.97<br />
2. Tax paid here %18, €94,49<br />
3. Total distance traveled to get it: ~400km which costs €100 for me here.<br />
4. Another €23 (for storage I assume)<br />
5. Other expenses €20 (see <a href="http://engin.bzzzt.biz/2011/04/02/importing-something-of-a-bit-of-a-value-for-personal-use-in-turkey-part-2/">part 2</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>
<p>Ordered item: €524<br />
Total expenses: €237 (%45 of item cost)</p>
<p>Anyway, I got all my stuff, including two sets of 8G RAM (one set for my vaio, one set for my macbook) and a C300 256G SSD.</p>
<p>I must tell you that, at first I was not impressed with the performance of SSD when I directly cloned my original hard disk to it. It was noticeably faster but not in a pants-dropping way.</p>
<p>Then, I've installed Windows 7 on it. I must say that it is quite fast, i.e. it cold starts Adobe Fireworks in 3 seconds, and hot starts in 1 second. Of course these are not scientific measurements, as I don't care about those very much either. The perceived speed determines the user experience. So far, it is quite good. Very snappy. We can attribute some of these perforamnce increase to MS technologies such as pre-fetch and superfetch. Oh well...</p>
