<p>Good thing, over the years life has thought me not to take her very seriously. Without a sense of humor, I couldn't survive this day.</p>
<ol>
<li>I went to the cargo terminal, I've tried to fill the paper they gave me. It is complete non-sense to any untrained eye and you MUST find someone to fill it for you which they charge you €25 for it. I bargained and had it for €10 though. By the way, see the irony here ? There's a totally off-the-record business market conceived around this government building. A government building with the sole purpose of making things on-the-record :)</li>
<li>I've paid the %18 tax (which is €94).</li>
<li>After a little bit more of paper work in the cargo terminal, they said that I could get my package from the antrepot now.</li>
<li>I drove to the antrepot only to find out that the last paper work done by the officers were incomplete and I have to go to the cargo terminal again. Though, office hours were about to come to an end... and it turned out I need to drive all the way to the cargo terminal in next business day.</li>
</ol>
<div>I started regretting not letting UPS did the work for me but I had one consolation so far which I was going to get my package before the weekend to play with it. Today those dreams are shattered :)</div>
<div>I think it is safe to say that I have spent around €200 (gas, tax, paper work) and wasted around 8 hours. Fantastic! That SSD drive better has a pants-dropping performance.</div>
<div>We'll see if I can get the package in monday :)</div>
