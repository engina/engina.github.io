          <h2>Importing something of a bit of a value for personal use in Turkey</h2>
<p class="meta">31 Mar 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I have ordered some nerd stuff worth of a bit more than €500 to be shipped from UK. From package tracking, I can tell that it arrived to Istanbul the very next day after the purchase but guess what. It needed clearance for customs. I've been told that if the package worths more than €150, it is highly likely to be stuck at the customs.</p>
<p>So what can I do ?</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the package myself</li>
<li>Pay a commission to UPS to get it for me (aprox. €83)</li>
</ol>
<div>I chose the first one to get the whole thing done in one day (boy could I be any more wrong), latter one requires a few business days. I've called UPS to get some information about the procedure and they've told me that I'd go to cargo terminal make the tax payment, come by their building and get the package. I went to cargo terminal only to find out that the procedure includes one more roundtrip. Here's the actual procedure.</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Go to the place called cargo terminal (next to the airport, a government facility) to get a paper signed by the manager that tells you want to get your package as a personal package.</li>
<li>Take that paper to UPS antrepot so the government inspector can inspect your package and writes a paragraph of text that it is OK for you to pay the tax for it and get it.</li>
<li>You go back to cargo terminal again to pay the tax (%18).</li>
<li>You go back to UPS antrepot again and get your package.</li>
</ol>
<div>OK, I've made a mistake and as manly tears of sorrow was running down my face I knew that I had to take it like a man! I started following the procedure.</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>I've drove to the cargo terminal (47km from my office). I got on the road at around 14:00 and I was there in 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Got the paper and paid €3 for parking in the terminal. I'd guess it took something around 30 minutes too.</li>
<li>I've went to the antrepot (20 km), I went to wrong address first so it was 15:40 when I was at the antrepot.</li>
<li>I got the government inspector to inspect my package and like 10 minutes but it took her 30 minutes to write one paragraph of text for me.</li>
<li>So, I was back at the cargo terminal (10km) at 17:00, their office hours ends in 17:30.</li>
<li>Long story short, with the delicate design of bureaucracy at the cargo terminal, I couldn't make it on time. Now I need to go there again.</li>
<li>I drove back to home (65km).</li>
</ol>
<div>Aftermath:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Wasted time: 4.5h</li>
<li>Distance: 150km of driving = 20lt of gas = €38 (yes, you've read it right, gas is €1.91/lt in Turkey)</li>
<li>Parking: €6 :)</li>
</ol>
<div>Like all these are not enough, there's this government officers' culture in Turkey. Given the little authority, they act like little gods of their domains. Maybe, that's because they get ridiculous salaries, do nothing useful in general and can be replaced with a few lines of code :) only god would know.</div>
</div>
<div>*sigh*</div>
</div>
<div>Oh, and for the curious ones among you, I'm getting a Crucial C300 256G SSD drive and 8gb RAM upgrade for my Vaio-Z790 and also for my Macbook.</div>
