<h1>k-menu alternative: xk-menu</h1>

I'm proud of being the father of the xk-menu -- an alternative to k-menu, obviously. I was asked to mimic winxp's menu, and that was exactly what I've did.

Well, technically, it's a kicker applet. It's component based. It reads .desktop files from $KDEDIR/share/xkmenu/ and generates the menu items. It reads KDE's own panel configuration, such as maximum number of recent menu entries, or the recent menu entries themselves, which means it blends into KDE quite well. It even honors your option on whether it should display recently used items or frequently used items! wow!

xk-menu is ultimetely custimizable! but for now, you can only customize what items to be listed in the two columns available. In reality, you can really put any widget you like on the menu. And since it uses .desktop files, menu items are translatable by design.

To be honest, it's written in a very limited time, and it's in alpha stage, but I prefer to use it instead of regular k-menu myself. <a href="files/xkmenu-20051110.tar.bz2">Download</a> and enjoy!
