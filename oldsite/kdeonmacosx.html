<h1>Native KDE/Kopete on MacOS X</h1>

I've compiled kdelibs4 snapshot and trunk/kopete against it a few weeks ago. Here's how it looks like, just for the record:

<p>
<div style="text-align:center"><a href="images/kopete_macosx.jpg"><img src="images/kopete_macosx_thumb.jpg"></a><br>Click for enlarged version</div>
</p>

Note that Kopete is using the MacOS X's global menu bar and it has a (crappy) dock icon. And you can see that X11 layer is not running at all.
<br>
And yes, I have my fair share of spams and kde-list mails!
