<h1>lighttpd vs apache2</h1>
<p>
well, after my tests yesterday, I was looking arond the web and I've ran into lighttpd and decided to give it a chance. Thanks to portage installation was just a command away and my htdocs just worked right away, which means I've shut apache down and started the lighttpd server and everything was the same (except for the regular cgi-bin directory). With this setup, we have the chance to compare Apache 2 and lighttpd 1.4.7 performances on static and PHP pages. The results are as follows;
</p>
<table border="1" align="center">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td>Apache 2</td><td>lighttpd 1.4.7</td></tr>
<tr><td>Static page</td><td>1000-1300</td><td>1800-2700</td></tr>
<tr><td>PHP5 script</td><td>56</td><td>68</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3" align="right">unit: requests/second</td></tr>
</table>


<p>
We also notice that PHP5 is slightly slower than PHP4 in this context. The previous test was done with PHP 4 and Apache 2 gave around 59 req/sec but PHP 5 and Apache 2 gives 56.
