<h1>What's this book about ?</h1>
<p>Study how to get a good job and love what you do.</p>
<p>Written by <a href="http://www.calnewport.com/books/sogood.html">Cal Newport.</a></p>
<h1>One Sentence Summary</h1>
<p>Good jobs are rare and to get something that is rare and you have to provide something that is valuable (rare) which is your expertise in that particular field gained through years of rigorous<strong> </strong>hard working.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Author is trying to answer the questions; how to get a good job and love what you do.</p>
<p>He starts by refusing the widely accepted career advice "following your passion". According to author, there's no one magical single true job waiting for you somewhere in the wild, instead, you grow to like your job as you get good at it. He presents scientific evidence that shows the likelihood of loving what you do correlates with how much time you spent on it. That's, the longer time you spent on a job, the more you like it as you become competent on it. <strong>This is rule #1</strong>. Author claims that there are MANY jobs that you can be passionate about once you are competent on it.</p>
<p>To answer the question "how to get a good job", however, we obviously first need to define what a good job is.</p>
<p>Author defines the <strong>traits of a good job</strong> as<br />
- <strong>Creativity </strong>: Being able to be creative at the job.<br />
- <strong>Impact </strong>: Make positive difference in the world.<br />
- <strong>Control </strong>: The amount of control you have in your daily life like when you wake up, when you can take a time off.</p>
<p>Then, author tells how all these traits are hard to find in jobs, which, in practice makes good jobs a rare commodity. In economics, supply and demand model dictates that if supply is low (good jobs are rare) and demand is high (everybody wants them) then the price will be high. Which, in practice, means that you have to offer a very good value to get these good jobs.</p>
<p>Offering good value to get a good job is attributed to "career capital". <strong>Career capital</strong> is your accumulated expertise in your field that you can offer to get that good job. <strong>This is rule #2</strong>.</p>
<p>After acquiring career capital, author says you can trade them with traits which makes a job great. For instance, if you prove to be an indispensable employee, you can demand less working hours -- <strong>control</strong>.</p>
<p>Author goes on to describe what is the most efficient way to acquire career capital, and that is deliberate practice. <strong>Deliberate practice</strong> is defined as always getting a bit out of your comfort zone and pushing your skills forward.</p>
<p>Even though there are three traits for making a job great, author emphasizes control trait the most and <strong>rule #3</strong> is that you should spend the career capital you gained for control on your daily life.</p>
<p>In the final rule, <strong>rule #4</strong>, the author starts mentioning a new concept: mission. Author claims that mission is one of the most important traits you can trade with your career capital for a compelling career. To acquire a mission however, you must be cutting edge in your field, so that you can see the next big thing and make that your mission. According to author, missions are tricky, so you must make little bets for reaching your missions. Such as monthly projects which attempts to solve one little piece at a time. If it fails move on, if it yields good results keep on.</p>
<h1>Criticism</h1>
<p>I found the book thought provoking.</p>
<p>Even though the traits of a good job are merely opinions and not a result of scientific study, I agree with them. Like many of the texts you'd find in this field of writing -- that is self improvement, maybe ? -- you often find very obvious answers to questions and this book is no exception. It says that you have to work real hard for real long time to get a good job. Obvious right ? Right. But it goes in detail to give you the grounds to realize what you are doing wrong.</p>
<p>For instance, I really could relate myself to many things written in the book. Like hitting the a performance plateau. I really started to avoid deliberate practice as I progressed in my professional career and that made me hit the performance plateau. Before reading this book, I have already started to realize this, so I was putting myself outside of my comfort zone to try to improve the quality of code I'm producing but this book made it very clear for how common and important a problem is this . These problems have been studied by performance scientists mentioned in the book.</p>
<p>So, generally, I came to agree with most of the conclusions drawn by the author.</p>
<p>Though, I think the book lacks scientific evidence on some of the theories it is suggesting, rendering them merely opinions. Also, in some occasions very little sample pool is used to draw conclusions (page 37).</p>
<p>Author makes some assumptions from his personal opinions of the concepts which is the very core of the book and builds the book on top of them but soon becomes a prisoner of these assumptions he made himself and religiously defends them. This reminded me of the term "intelligence trap" as defined by Edward de Bono.</p>
<p>He goes on to rule "follow your passion" advice out completely and defend this thought whatsoever. I think this is not a black and white area and we should be more open. For instance check this bit.</p>
<p>In the book, there's a story of a musician named Jordan Tice. Author explains how hard Tice worked to get to the point where he is now.</p>
<blockquote><p>It asks you to leave behind self-centered concerns about whether your job is "just right", and instead put your head down and plug away at getting really damn good.</p></blockquote>
<p>The author suggests Tice didn't question if being a musician is the right job for him or not, he put his head down and worked his ass of regardless and once he got competent on it he became passionate.</p>
<p>Author, immediately quotes one of the many similar arguments he heard from his readers against this theory.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tice is willing to grind out long hours with little recognition, but that's because it's in service to something he's obviously passionate about and has been for a long time. He's found that one job that's right for him.</p></blockquote>
<p>He defends his stands with:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't buy it.<br />
First, let's dispense with the notion that performers like Jordan Tice or Steve Martin are perfectly secure in their knowledge that they've found their true calling.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the fact that they were insecure does not mean that they were not passionate. I believe, they kept bettering themselves against all the odds because they were passionate about what they do. <strong>The thing we should study here is <em>what is it that ignites the passion in the first place.</em></strong></p>
<p>Author is also a amateur musician and compares himself to Tice:</p>
<blockquote><p>To the high school version of myself, the idea of learning complicated lead parts by ear would have been way past my threshold of mental strain and patience. But Jordan came to enjoy this labor.</p></blockquote>
<p>But skips to study the reason why Jordan enjoyed that labor. I call it passion.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I took what I could to the best of my ability from the book and enlightened in some ways but, to be honest, I do think the thoughts presented in the book are not of book quality yet as they are often opinions rather than scientific facts. They might be accurate or not but I expect a more scientific approach in books.  But that might be just me.</p>
