<p>It was like 4 months ago. I was waiting for something indefinitely in a hospital. Luckily though I had my old cute iBook with me, which includes a gcc in it! Even Eclipse! Then I saw the sudoku puzzle in the papers. So I quickly coded a sudoku solver in C in a couple of hours. I could have had added many algorithms in it, but I just added the most simplest one and it surprisingly worked in my first try :) This one simple algorithm is able to solve easy leveled sudoku puzzles. Though one can add as many algorithms as necessary. Everything is 655 lines of C code -- with all the formatting and the comments (if any). Here's the <a href="http://engin.bzzzt.biz/files/fikifiki.tar.bz2">code</a>. This will probably be used by some lazy ass students  :)</p>
<p>You can compile by either invoking "make" in Release or Debug directories, or just import the project in Eclipse and enjoy there.</p>
