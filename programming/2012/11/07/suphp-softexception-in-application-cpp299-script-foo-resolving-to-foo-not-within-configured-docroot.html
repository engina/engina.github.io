<div class="post">
<p>Recently I've switched to suphp from regular mod_php to support one application (wordpress) better and for obvious security benefits. Though, one of my application worked flawlessly, another one failed with the following error message in the log.</p>
<p>Actual error:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">[Wed Nov 07 19:35:27 2012] [error] [client 78.171.237.162] SoftException in Application.cpp:299: Script "/home/engin/www/api.php" resolving to "/home/engin/www/api.php" not within configured docroot</pre>
<p>It's easy to think that this is related to Apache vhost configuration's DocumentRoot but it is not.</p>
<p>My application which is working was located in <strong>/home/usera/public_html</strong> and the failing one was in <strong>/home/userb/www</strong>. Now check the <strong>/etc/suphp/suphp.conf</strong>'s <strong>docroot</strong> variable:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">docroot=/var/www:${HOME}/public_html</pre>
<p>As you see, <strong>${HOME}/public_html</strong> is in the docroot, hence one of my application was working and the other one was not. I moved www to public_html and all is fixed.</p>
