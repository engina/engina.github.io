          <h2>Wireless module of Sony VAIO VGN-Z790 broken</h2>
<p class="meta">11 Mar 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Me and my partner got two Sony VAIO VGN-Z790DIB notebooks 1.5 years ago. Admittedly, I still think it is the best PC notebook out there (P9700 CPU, 4G RAM, 1.47kg, ~6h battery). Though, wireless module of my partner's notebook stopped working in the first month. The wireless module got physically broken, completely disappeared from system as it is not connected at all.</p>
<p>Today, it turned out that these notebooks have some kind of design fault, as mine also got broken. It literally disappeared all of a sudden. It is not a software problem as it is not seen by GNU/Linux or anything.</p>
<p>I tried to order another Wireless Module for VGN-Z790 but all my searches failed. Then, I decided to disassemble it, in hope that I could find a part number etc. After all, I have changed broken parts of my previous notebooks anyway.</p>
<p>It is a very painful task to disassemble this notebook. It took almost 1h to disassemble and assemble the notebook back. Here's the <a href="http://engin.bzzzt.biz/files/Vgn_z_e.zip">service manual</a> for VGN-Z series, it is almost impossible to work on this notebook without this. I'd expect a much better service manual from a company such as Sony, but it was quite low quality if you ask me. Dell's service manuals were way better.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got it! The wireless module of VGN-Z790 is 512AN_HMW. You can see the pictures below.</p>

<p>Luckily, if you search with this model number you can find this part from ebay. I'll order one soon and see if it is the module that is getting broken or it is something else that is affecting it -- only if I don't get a new notebook! This is a pretty damn good excuse to get one, amarite ?</p>
