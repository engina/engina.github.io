<p><a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">gnuplot</a> is an unbelievably good tool, if you don't know it yet, check it out. Though the gnuplot Windows package has performance problems. No matter how much I tweaked the parameters and tried different rendering engines (terminal in gnuplot jargon), I couldn't fix it. It was taking more than 5 seconds to render 350k data points.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> is a part of my toolchain. Today I figured I might give gnuplot with Cygwin/X11 a shot. Cygwin also has a gnuplot package which is built for Cygwin environment. Cygwin also has a X11 package, so that you can run a X11 server on your Windows box. Actually there are several other X11 server implementations for Windows out there, even commercial ones. Â Anyway, I've tried to plot my graphs using Cygwin gnuplot and X11. And voila! It was about 5 times faster.</p>
<p>So, having gnuplot performance problems on Windows ? If you don't mind installing Cygwin (which is simply a double click and next, next, next) you can enjoy a faster gnuplot experience.</p>
